## FAQ

### Why isn't my question in the FAQ?
Well, for one I don't know your questions; I'm not omniscient. Secondly, Dan and Anna haven't gotten around to filling this out yet.  


### Do you have any questions, Steve?
Why, yes, yes I do: What questions are frequently asked, and do they belong in the FAQ?  


### Can I see a longer answer with subpoints?
Sure thing boss.
Some questions might require a more detailed explanation, covered under multiple headers.  

#### Does it look nice when the header is indented?
I think it looks pretty nice, but thats subjective.  

#### What's an alternative solution?
We can just change the font size or weight if they like that better.


### What do the questions look like when they follow a detailed answer?
They look like this question.
