# Dear Friends,

With COVID-19 keeping us all at home, we will not be moving forward with a June 28, 2020 wedding. While we are disappointed, everyone's health and safety are more important.

Don't worry, we are still getting married, so stay tuned for more updates as we work with our venue and vendors to find the best way to celebrate.


Stay safe and stay healthy.
